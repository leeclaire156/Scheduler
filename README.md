# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This project utilizes third party APIs, Day.js and jQuery.js to create a work day (starting from 9 am to 5 pm) scheduler that allows the user to input events for each hour, save them, and clear them at the end of the day. In addition, there are color-coded text areas for each time block to indicate past (grey), present (red), and future (green) events based on the current time.
